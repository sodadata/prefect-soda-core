    Task that execute a Soda Scan.
    First, the scan is created and configured using the provided
    configuration, checks, and other options, and then
    it is executed against the provided data source.

    Args:
        data_source_name: The name of the data source against
            which the checks will be executed. The data source name
            must match one of the data sources provided in the
            `configuration` object.
        configuration: `SodaConfiguration` object that will be used
            to configure the scan before its execution.
        checks: `SodaCLCheck` object that will be used, together with
            `configuration`, to configure the scan before its execution.
        variables: A `Dict[str, str]` that contains all variables
            references within checks.
        scan_results_file: The path to the file where the scan results
            will be stored. If not provided, the scan results will not
            be stored on the file system and only the stdout of the soda
            shell task would be returned.
        verbose: Whether to run the checks with a verbose log or not.
            Default to `False`.
        return_scan_result_file_content: Controls the return of the task.
            If `True`, the task will return the content of the scan results,
            otherwise it will return the stdout of the soda shell task.
            Default to `False`.
        shell_env: A `Dict[str, str]` that contains all environment variables
            that will be passed to the soda shell task.

    Raises:
        `RuntimeError` in case `soda scan` encounters any error
            during execution.

    Returns:
        Logs produced by running `soda scan` CLI command.

    Example:
        ```python
