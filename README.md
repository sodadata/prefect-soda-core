# prefect-soda-core

## Welcome!

Prefect 2.0 collection for Soda Core

## Getting Started

### Python setup

Requires an installation of Python 3.7+.

We recommend using a Python virtual environment manager such as pipenv, conda or virtualenv.

These tasks are designed to work with Prefect 2.0. For more information about how to use Prefect, please refer to the [Prefect documentation](https://orion-docs.prefect.io/).

### Installation


`prefect-soda-core` is based on `soda-core`.  
As `soda-core` requires you to specify the right option for your database, so does `prefect-soda-core`.  
I.e. to use `prefect-soda-core` with Snowflake, run the following:

```bash
pip install prefect-soda-core[snowflake]
```

You can find the list of supported options in `setup.py`.

**Please note that since this integration is built on top of Soda CLI, it is not possible to run data quality checks using Spark.**

### Write and run a flow

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect_soda_core.soda_configuration import SodaConfiguration
from prefect_soda_core.sodacl_check import SodaCLCheck
from prefect_soda_core.tasks import soda_scan_execute


@flow
def run_soda_scan():
    soda_configuration_block = SodaConfiguration(
        configuration_yaml_path="/path/to/config.yaml"
    )
    soda_check_block = SodaCLCheck(
        sodacl_yaml_path="/path/to/checks.yaml"
    )
    
    # Using the flow_run_name as the name of the file to store the scan results
    flow_run_name = get_run_context().flow_run.name
    scan_results_file_path = f"{flow_run_name}.json"
    
    return soda_scan_execute(
        data_source_name="my_datasource",
        configuration=soda_configuration_block,
        checks=soda_check_block,
        variables={"var": "value"},
        scan_results_file=scan_results_file_path,
        verbose=True
        return_scan_result_file_content=False,
        shell_env={"SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD": "********"}
    )

run_soda_scan()
```
